# keep-server

Keep is a note taking service that mirrors [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/). The motivation behind this project is to have something tangible to build and try out new technologies on in order to grow and deepen my skills as an engineer and software developer.

## Mission

This is not a deliverable. Speed is not a priority. Take time to learn and try new things, be creative, be curious, and grow foundational skills as an engineer.

In general, I'll build the service in JavaScript and look to explore and use industry standard tools in the JavaScript ecosystem.

## Tools to explore

- TypeScript
- Express
- GraphQL
- MongoDb
- PostgreSQL
- AWS

## TODO

- Design the data model
- Choose a server framework and build out a running local server
- More...
